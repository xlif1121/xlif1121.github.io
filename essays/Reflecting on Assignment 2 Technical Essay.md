<b>Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details Assignment 2 contains the login page and register new users page on the basis of assignment 1. </b>

<p>The addition of those new content makes this online store web page look more like a real online store. In assignment 2, when customers want to purchase the products, they will be forced to jump to the login page. If they do not have an account, they can click the Register button on the login page. The registration button can take the customer to the registration page, and the registered account must meet the requirements to successfully register. Without a login account, customers cannot view the products and quantities that have been ordered. After successfully logging in to the account, the customer will be able to see the invoice page, When the customer completes the transaction, click the complete order button to jump to the thank you page, and the estimated delivery time of the product will be displayed.</p>



<b>What did you learn from this assignment? </b>

<p>In this assignment 2, I learned how to use code to create my own online store. Also, I learned how to create a login page and register new users' pages to make my online store look more real. What I am most proud of is that the errors and inoperable programs in assignment 1 have been revised in assignment 2. I applied the knowledge that I learned from Labs and WODs to this assignment. Using Google or W3school websites to search for the code or function is also one thing that I learned.  I have a deeper understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in assignment2. The knowledge I learn now is to lay a solid foundation for my future ITM courses.</p>

<b>Did you work with a partner?</b>

<p>Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself). I did all the assignments by myself.</p> 

<b>How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?</b>

<p>When I encounter difficulties, I will go to w3schools and class zoom recording to get some ideas first. If I still can't solve the problem, I will ask professor Port to help me. Most of the problems I encountered were code problems, spelling errors, code misplaced, a number is typed in the wrong place or missed the number, and the wrong function problems. </p>

<b>How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1? </b>

<p>Assignment2 is built on the basis of assignment1, but assignment2 is more complicated than assignment1, and there are more codes. This also means that I need to pay more patience and care to complete assignment2.</p>

<b>Estimate the % of the time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging</b>

<p>I spend 20% of my time thinking about how to do it and putting my own ideas inside. 80% of the time I use to write code and query for help. The last 10% of the time I use to debug and test, I know that 10% of the time is not enough for testing, but I always try to start it early.</p> 

<b>Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?</b>

<p>I spent the least time writing CSS because I can find the templates that I like in w3schools, and I can code my own ideas. However, the worst thing is that I have a lot of functions and codes that I am not familiar with, and it takes time to search about the function or the code.</p>

<b>If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?</b>

<p>If I can go back in time, I would try to start my assignments as soon as possible and try to not procrastinate.</p>
