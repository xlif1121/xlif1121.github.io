  In the last WODs, I learned about HTML, CSS, Javascript, VS Code, LiveReload, and Chrome Developer Tools. Summarizing the experience in browser history assignments, this time I read the instructions more carefully, and make sure I won’t miss some of the instructions or important information. Also, I tried to do it at least two times, so I can basically operate very proficiently. If the DNF time is not within my expected range, I will definitely try again and strive to meet my expected range. I feel that the invoice assignment is more difficult than the browser history because it is complicated, and I need to type in a lot of numbers in this assignment. Once a number is typed in the wrong place or missed the number, it will directly lead to the final result of the failure. Also, I will waste precious time looking for where the error is. Thus, I will save every time I complete a task and refresh the web page to see if it is correct or there are differences. If any, I will find the problem and fix it immediately. 

  I had the same problem in the first two attempts. For example, I regarded apostrophes as single brackets, multiple input errors, and accidentally deleted some numbers. These mistakes caused prolonged the DNF time and lead to failure to reach my expectations. Fortunately, I corrected the mistakes I had made before for the third time and carefully compared the professor’s example after doing it. The most important thing is to carefully check for errors when doing it. I often ignore these small problems because the assignment seems simple. However, these small mistakes can accumulate into a huge problem. Finally, time is wasted to find out the problem. Therefore, I will learn from the failure and improve my skills in the next WOD assignment. Also, try to finish it as quickly as possible to achieve the DNF time that I expect.
