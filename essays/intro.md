My name is Xinfei Li but because my name is difficult to say in English, people usually call me Faye. I was born in Guangxi, China in 2000 and moved out to Hawaii with my parents a couple of years ago. I like to edit videos, play mobile games, play badminton, photography, cook, and draw during my free time. 

I enrolled in ITM 352 because I am interested in coding, and I think this class will be useful for my future ITM classes.
