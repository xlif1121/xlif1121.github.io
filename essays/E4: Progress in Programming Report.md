My programming skills have been greatly improved in this course because I didn't know anything about JavaScript, HTML, and CSS before. However, I have seen my friend typing code, and it feels very complicated. I never thought that one day I would also have programming skills, and also apply these skills in real life. For example, if I want to create an online store webpage, I can use the code to create my own webpage. Also, I can use my programming skills in office jobs, which will reduce my time and workload. I still need to carefully check the mistake and learn more functions to improve my programming skills. Constantly learning new skills is crucial to me because the knowledge I learn now is to lay a solid foundation for my future ITM courses. 

When I work on WODs, I always try to do it by myself first. If I encounter difficult questions or parts, I will still choose to view the screencast solutions to prevent mistakes. I hope that in the near future, I will be able to do all the WODs and labs without watching the screencast solutions first. The lab is the most helpful assignment for me because it can help me to be ready for the next stages of complexity in programming. I am looking forward to learning different programming knowledge and skills in different labs, which will make me feel fulfilled. Moreover, these labs can help me complete more complicated homework in the future. These are things that work really well for my learning in this class because my DNF time to do WOD has become shorter and shorter, which proves that I am slowly beginning to understand and learn programming skills. From the frustration of not knowing how to type code at the beginning, to the full confidence now, I am very fortunate to have chosen this class as my minor major because I think it will be useful and helpful for me, and it will lead me to success in the future.
