I followed the demonstration video to finish it step by step for the first try. During this period, I started a countdown, trying to control the DNF time within 15 minutes for the first try. However, I was a little nervous because I have to talk while I coding. As a result,  I made multiple input errors and prolonged the time. Later, the stop time was about 18 minutes, and it does not meet my expectations, so I deleted the first version and tried it again. The second time I did it without watching the demonstration video. Also, I used the Active Presenter screencast software, and then I started a countdown to see if I can control the DNF time within 15 minutes. Fortunately, the second time I completed it in about 15 minutes. After I completed the BrowserHistory1 recording, I export the video from the Active Presenter and upload it to my personal YouTube channel.  When doing BrowserHistory2 and 3, I used the skills and same strategies I learned from BrowserHistory1. 

My suggestion is to read the instructions carefully. Otherwise, you will miss the important information and wasting your time. You should try to download some screen recording software and make sure it is exported for free. I think the timer is much more convenient than the countdown because when you pause the countdown, you have to calculate how long you spent in total. However, the timer directly shows the time you spent (My own opinion). Try to do it at least 2 times by yourself, so that you can find out your problem and find a solution. After trying 3 times, I believe that you can basically operate very proficiently. If the DNF time is not within your expected range, you should try again and strive to meet your expected range. What you should avoid is that follow the demonstration video step by step while you recording the video because you wonâ€™t be able to learn anything besides copy and paste. Also, the skills and knowledge that you learned from WODs will be useful for future labs and assignments.
